PYTHON PROJECT FOR DATA SCIENCE, AI and DEVELOPMENT, COURSERA:

For this project, I took on the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst at a startup investment firm, focusing on helping customers make informed stock investment decisions. I used Python libraries and web scraping techniques to extract financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources. The stocks I analyzed included Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

After collecting and cleaning the data, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize key trends and patterns, providing insights into stock performance. This project allowed me to enhance my skills in data extraction, analysis, and visualization, as well as my ability to translate data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
